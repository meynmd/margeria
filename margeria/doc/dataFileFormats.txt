Container Files should be in the following format:

Name	RoomId	(x,y)	L | U	KeyRoomId	(keyX,keyY)



Door (RoomExit) Files in this format:

Name	RoomId	(x,y)	DestRoomId	(destX,destY)	L | U	keyRoomId	(keyX,keyY)

If door not locked, keyRoomId and (keyX,keyY) are not necessary.



Animation Files have a 5 line header:

# of frames
delay before start
delay between frames
delay at end
[xDimension,yDimension]

where delays are in milliseconds, and dimensions are in game tiles.

Frames begin immediately below header, with one empty line between frames.
