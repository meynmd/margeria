You get up off the cold hard floor of the tiny cell in the castle dungeon. By the light of a single candle in the corner, you can see the heavy wooden crate which you have been using as a writing desk to compose secret letters to your loyal supporters. Across the room is the locked door. At the opposite corner, foul-smelling air flows through a tiny barred window.
